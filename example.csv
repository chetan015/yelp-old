I am so done with you Papa John's.  When I moved I thought well this is the only pizza joint nearby that delivers but I have since found a few others to try.  I only went to you out of inertia. Do NOT, Do NOT try to trick me with the free pizza award for my latest complaint that you gave me extra sauce when I ordered light sauce.  Because i will THROW it away.  I hope I will be giving some other delivery pizza joint a good review soon.",2011-05-10 22:30:59

Because upon arriving in Phoenix after a six hour drive and having a whole moving truck to unload, this place was a welcomed source of food for me and the entourage helping us to haul stuff into the new apartment.

The pizza itself was nothing really all that special.  In my opinion, Domino's actually tastes better, but the service was good, my wife likes the dipping sauce, and we all got perfectly serviceable food exactly when we needed it.

Thanks.  We'll get pizza here on occasion.  At least you can easily order here on an iPhone.",2011-07-19 15:29:57
CKuobAL_GMDq-ypQM0cX7w,l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,bhosqo-Q1xp67iLqrd1Rbw,3.0,1,0,0,"Better pizza than Little Caesar's, less greasy than Pizza Hut, and about the same quality as Dominoe's pizza. It is close to my home and they throw a cute little pepper and some garlic dipping sauce in the box with the pizza. So, if we decide to go with a chain pizza place, it is frequently this Papa John's. 
Parking is easy and right at the front door for pick up. We have never used the delivery service, so not sure about that. They usually get the order right if you call it in (as opposed to ordering online), but did have to call us back once because they weren't sure that the guy taking the order had written it down right (he hadn't).",2012-01-23 15:05:23

My ordeal with these people started Super Bowl Sunday 2012. Pick the coin flip and win a free pizza. Nothing to lose right? My wife and I chose heads, America chose heads, it was heads in the game, everyone wins a free pizza. 

Generally we only order pizza from mom and pop joints as they are better quality, taste and seriously the chains are just terrible, but this price was right.

Move ahead two weeks and we order the free pizza. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. 90 minutes later we get the pizza, nasty and cold. 

A week later, in an effort to right their marketing wrong Papa Johns offers us a free pizza, two liter, and free side of our choice. We order and wait. And Wait. And wait. An hour after they were supposed to show they finally get here. Pizza is cold and nasty. And they forget the side. I realize $8 per hour doesn't exactly inspire the best work or get the best employees but when I called in the guy on the phone was rude and extremely unhelpful. No doubt he was used to fielding calls from angry customers. 

The bottom line here is that this is terrible pizza, with even worse service and delivery. We didn't pay a dime (except for $2 delivery fee...twice) and we still feel like we got screwed. With so many other places to go to get your pie, save yourself the headache and wait of this dump. They should be out of business and hopefully will be soon.",2012-02-21 02:33:46
KWI07SPOAxJBSiVWvgaWzg,iN7T3vQoC3v_MPs2TzH5Zw,bhosqo-Q1xp67iLqrd1Rbw,2.0,2,4,0,"A friend and I decided to order a pizza that was close enough to pick up, to save the delivery charge.  Starving and excited for pizza, we set out to pick up an order we'd placed online.  The first problem wasn't their fault: they appeared  on the NE side of the intersection on my GPS, rather than SE.  As we drove around hoping to stumble upon PJs, I called the store.  Second problem was that phone call.  After I endured a 4 minute spiel from a recording, the call was finally answered just to ask me to ""hold please"".  He did come back and give me better directions, and within 40 seconds we were pulling up to the right parking lot.  The storefront was TINY, I'd never have noticed it if I wasn't looking so hard.

The interaction inside was just kinda strange.  The guy at the counter seemed confused by us wanting to pick up our order, confused that I was trying to also purchase two soft drinks, and confused by the fact that we would be paying in one transaction.  He was totally baffled by the request for extra parmesan packets, and required us to explain twice before he could give us more pepperoncinis.  

After all that, the pizza was fantastic.  It could have had something to do with the fact that we were so hungry, but I have zero complaints about the food.  Maybe if we'd chosen delivery been able to avoid the experience with the man in the store, I'd add another star or two.",2012-09-24 23:20:42

Ordered carry out & had to wait 5 minutes for someone to help me while my pizza sat in the window getting cold. Pizza was cold, the toppings were skimpy & they shorted my order of chicken poppers which were gross anyway. Wouldn't order from here again.",2013-04-16 01:23:26
MgMOz4GzrQYx72iAH08kTg,_5ojXvhUSXPVP4YSwl2ljw,bhosqo-Q1xp67iLqrd1Rbw,4.0,1,0,0,This Papa John's location is our regular location for ordering pizza. My girlfriend and I have been very satisfied with their service. They have a very friendly staff and are very fast at delivering without compromising the quality of the food. There have been a few times where they accidentally put pepperoni on our entire pizza when we always order half pepperoni because my girlfriend is a vegetarian but in both occasions they immediately sent us another pizza with the correct toppings free of charge. We understand accidents happen but we are primarily happy with the way they correct them.,2014-04-24 00:11:04

Ordered delivery the other day, a small Tuscan 6 cheese pizza and wings.  The pizza delivered was the regular cheese pizza.  It was hot and very good. The next morning I realized it was supposed to be the Tuscan 6 cheese pizza.  There is a $4.00 difference so I wanted to let the company know I was sent the wrong pizza.  I wrote a quick email explaining that I received the wrong pizza.  The next day, I received  a call from the district manager.  He apologized and gave me a credit for a large pizza.  Great customer service and quick response.  Wasn't expecting anything free just wanted the few dollars credited back to me from the wrong pizza delivered, however, Papa John's management went above and beyond!  Will definitely patronize this establishment in the future!",2015-11-04 19:07:00
v8B9aWkFaT7H36FavdfToQ,GGP8_2OxdWTNIsQB0eW7TA,bhosqo-Q1xp67iLqrd1Rbw,2.0,0,1,0,"Last night, January 6th, my fiancee and ordered a large pizza and a liter of soda for delivery around 11pm. We understand that it was pretty late, but we were assured that it would be okay. So we placed our order, and 40 minutes later our pizza arrived. We stood outside and we noticed a car that kept driving up and down the street, going pretty fast, then realized it was the delivery driver. So we walked up to help him locate our home. The driver pulled up, rolled down his window, and handed us the pizza and liter of soda through his window. Then he said, and I quote, ""I won't bother you to sign your receipt, but if you were to tip me, how much do you want to give me?"" I wanted to not tip him all together, but my fiancee decided to tip him $6, which he clearly did not deserve.I understand it was late and we were probably the last delivery of the night, but come on. That was just lazy and so incredibly unprofessional. The pizza itself was delicious, hence the two starts, but I would rather order from a different location to assure I don't have to deal with that particular driver again.",2016-01-08 05:42:25

The quoted wait was 80-90 minutes (blah). However, it was here in 54, with an apology from the driver for the wait. I was concerned the food wouldn't be as great as last time because of the long wait (perhaps sitting in the warmer, or drivers car), but I was wrong, it was perfect again! 

Original review: I've been eating Papa John's for the last 20 years. I've ordered it in dozens of cities from dozens of different franchises. This location officially baked the best original papa johns breadsticks I have ever eaten. As much as I love them, I will say they are usually a bit hard for my preference, but this time they were baked to sweet perfection. The pizza was good too. Delivery was timely especially for a Friday night (34 minutes to be exact). This review is based off of one order, so I can't speak to the consistency, but so far, 5 stars.",2016-04-10 07:42:22

I tried to order online this time for the first time ever. I was given a coupon for 50% off, website said not valid. Oh well, thought I'd order it anyway. When I got to the checkout they wanted $6 for delivery. WTF? On top of that they wanted $2.26 for something called door and dash quality assurance or some crap like that. That means my delivery was $8.26? On top of that I'm a decent Tipper. Add 5 bucks to that and we're looking at $13.26 extra for a $15 Pizza. Papa John's can suck a butt.

It takes them at least an hour to deliver a pizza, by the time it gets in my hands it's cold, and paying for extra toppings is useless because they always skimp on them.
